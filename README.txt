All of the code I wrote is in main.py; the other python files were provided and used
for image alignment.
To view the results of running various functions on the inputs on my webpage, 
uncomment lines at the bottom of the file corresponding to each function.
  You can use the show() on the output of any function to visualize it.
  You can use the save(image, filename.jpg) command to save the output of a function.
Any function that asks for parameters (alpha, sigma) is referring to the parameters
of a Gaussian kernel; the width of the Gaussian kernel in memory will be ALPHA, and
the "blurriness" or deviation of the distribution.
