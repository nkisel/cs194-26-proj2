            <h3>Finite difference operator</h3>

            <p> <b>Taking the partial derivative of the cameraman image in the x & y directions to find its edges. </b> </p>
            <br style="line-height:18%;">
            <p>
                Simply taking the derivative of the cameraman image results in a mess - since almost every pixel differs from its neighbors,
                you end up seeing edges practically everywhere. In this case, a threshold for the strength of an edge
                is useful for throwing out meaningless edges. This greatly improves edge detection on the original image, but
                there remain some strong differences in the color of the scenery particularly underneath the cameraman.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the grass has lots of color changes over individual pixels, it can still be thought of as a green block overall. 
                To remedy the noise in the grass, I took the Gaussian G(4, 1) of the image and found that most of the aforementioned noise was gone,
                and the silhouette of the man & his camera was yet stronger than before. Using the Gaussian to smooth out the
                grass brings us to that blurred, generalized green area and removes the edges. As a result, you can't see any specks
                representing the high volume of edges in the grass in the resultant image!
            </p>

            <p> <b> Testing the commutativity of convolution. </b></p>
            <br style="line-height:18%;">
            <p>
                I replicated the previous experiment, where I took the gaussian of an image before convolving it in the x and y directions.
                Then, I took the derivative of the gaussian in both the x & y directions before applying each derivative-of-gaussian to the image and combining their results.
                As you can see, the output of the two processes is exactly the same.

    <h2>Fun with Frequencies</h2>

    <h3>Image Sharpening</h3>

    <p>
        The unsharp masking technique utilizes the same Gaussian as before, but subtracts that Gaussian from the original image.
        The resultant matrix contains just the sharp corners of the image without much of the original solid color.
        This process allows us to add the sharp corners into the image once more to amplify their sharpness. In the sharpened Taj Mahal, 
        you might be able to see artifacts in the sky around the building's edges that look like a digital version of a mirage.
        Note that radically increasing the sharpness results in the corners and edges of the 
        photo becoming so bright that the contrast of the rest of the photo decreases; this manifests
        slightly in the blurred-then-sharpened version.

        This process can be useful in moderation, but it doesn't particularly restore blurry photos well. 
        You'll note that the edges of the Taj Mahal become sharper, but none of the inner patterns re-appear.
        You'd need to feed the computer a lot of different surfaces through deep learning to add detail where there isn't any,
        as the unsharp mask probably doesn't restore the detail in the ways you'd like.

            Using the low-pass filtering of the Gaussian and the sharpening of the unsharp filter,

            Sometimes, it's <i>really hard</i> to get these images working. It turns out that many features - facial, scenic, etc. -
            need to align in order to mask any afterimages.

        <h4>Gaussian & Laplacian stacks</h4>

        <div>
            <p>
                Starting from the original image, I iteratively applied the Gaussian to consecutive blurred
                versions of the same image, resulting in a five-image stack of more and more blurry photos. 
                Then, for each level of the Gaussian stack, I subtracted the previous level's Gaussian 
                blurred image and set it aside into a separate stack - the Laplacian stack. The Laplacian stack
                essentially represents unmask filters on different sets of frequencies for the photo;
                in other words, the edges of the photo at different blur levels.

                            </li>

                <p> Now, I tried the same thing using a photo I took of Crater Lake and the San Diego skyline, but it didn't work so well. </p>

            <p> A primary reason was that the environments don't conceal each other's backgrounds well. The blurring effect isn't particularly nice to the sharp corners here, 
                so the high contrast points like the trees, mountains, and buildings end up blending with the sky in both photos. </p>
            <img src="out/crater.jpg" alt="A failure">
            <p> Lowering the size of the Gaussian kernel helps out with the execution of putting a skyline into nature, but removes much of the color. </p>

            <p> Putin's facial features really bring out a sense of three-dimensionality in this photo. It also becomes clear that the Mona Lisa - I mean Putin - is <i>definitely</i> looking away. </p>
            <img src="out/mona_putin.jpg" alt="A failure">
            <p> I really like how the left cheeks of Putin & Mona Lisa align. Perhaps the color of Putin's face could be adjusted a little. </p>
